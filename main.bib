		  on types of ingredients used in packaged foods. USDA’s
		  Global Branded Food Products Database makes publicly
		  available a compiled dataset of ingredient lists for over a
		  quarter million commercial food products. This paper
		  reports on the development of a framework for parsing and
		  systematic reporting of ingredients used in commercially
		  packaged foods (IngID) in the US and delineates the
		  complexity and challenges of current ingredient lists,
		  using baked products to illustrate. The major steps in the
		  development of IngID prototype were 1) identifying
		  top-selling baked products, 2) obtaining their ingredient
		  lists, 3) parsing individual ingredients after several
		  pre-processing steps as ingredient lists were inconsistent
		  and varied, 4) building a thesaurus by assigning a
		  preferred descriptor to equivalent terms such as synonyms
		  and spelling errors, and 5) assigning broader terms such as
		  flour, sweeteners. The current version of IngID includes 3
		  main files - an input Food details file, an output file of
		  parsed text strings, and a thesaurus of ∼6500 parsed
		  ingredients. IngID can help improve our understanding of
		  commercial ingredients, characterizing foods in dimensions
		  other than the traditional nutrient profiles, development
		  of food ontology, computer programs and artificial
		  intelligence tools.}

		  researcher reports an estimate ĉ of a structural quantity
		  of interest c that is exactly or asymptotically unbiased
		  under some base model. The researcher also reports
		  descriptive statistics that estimate features γ of the
		  distribution of the data that are related to c under the
		  base model. A reader entertains a less restrictive model
		  that is local to the base model, under which the estimate
		  ĉ may be biased. We study the reduction in worst-case bias
		  from a restriction that requires the reader's model to
		  respect the relationship between c and γ specified by the
		  base model. Our main result shows that the proportional
		  reduction in worst-case bias depends only on a quantity we
		  call the informativeness of for ĉ. Informativeness can be
		  easily estimated even for complex models. We recommend that
		  researchers report estimated informativeness alongside
		  their descriptive analyses, and we illustrate with
		  applications to three recent papers.},

  abstract	= "This paper augments the neoclassical growth model to study
		  the macroeconomic effects of uninsured idiosyncratic
		  investment, or capital-income, risk. Under standard
		  assumptions for preferences and technologies, individual
		  policy rules are linear in individual wealth, ensuring that
		  the equilibrium dynamics for aggregate quantities and
		  prices are independent of the wealth distribution. The
		  analysis thus remains highly tractable despite the
		  incompleteness of markets. As compared to complete markets,
		  the steady state is characterized by both a lower interest
		  rate and a lower capital stock when the elasticity of
		  intertemporal substitution is higher than the fraction of
		  private equity in total wealth. For empirically plausible
		  parameterizations, this condition is easily satisfied, and
		  the reduction in aggregate saving and income is
		  quantitatively significant. These findings contrast with
		  Bewley models, where idiosyncratic labor-income risk leads
		  to higher aggregate saving and income."

		  in the UK. The value of the international comparisons for
		  the discussion of tax reform lies in studying the
		  implications of applying a UK tax code to the French
		  population (or vice versa). The French tax code is
		  redistributive in the 2 dimensions considered -- income and
		  family size. However, there has been pressure for reform,
		  with one target being the familial quotient. The dominance
		  conditions are not satisfied by a reform replacing the
		  quotient by a UK-style standard deduction. In order to
		  secure dominance, a package of measures, such as raising
		  child benefits, is needed. The devising of tax reform is
		  not straightforward, and for this reason, the development
		  of accessible tax-benefit models is of great importance."

  abstract	= {This paper presents a model of consumer demand that is
		  consistent with the observed expenditure patterns of
		  individual consumers in a long time series of expenditure
		  surveys and is also able to provide a detailed welfare
		  analysis of shifts in relative prices. A nonparametric
		  analysis of consumer expenditure patterns suggests that
		  Engel curves require quadratic terms in the logarithm of
		  expenditure. While popular models of demand such as the
		  Translog or the Almost Ideal Demand Systems do allow
		  flexible price responses within a theoretically coherent
		  structure, they have expenditure share Engel curves that
		  are linear in the logarithm of total expenditure. We derive
		  the complete class of integrable quadratic logarithmic
		  expenditure share systems. A specification from this class
		  is estimated on a large pooled data set of U.K. households.
		  Models that fail to account for Engel curvature are found
		  to generate important distortions in the patterns of
		  welfare losses associated with a tax increase.},

  abstract	= {The advent of cheap smartphones in rural areas across the
		  globe presents an opportunity to change the mode with which
		  researchers engage hard-to-reach populations. In
		  particular, smartphones allow researchers to connect with
		  respondents more frequently than standard household
		  surveys, opening a new window into important short-term
		  variability in key measures of household and community
		  wellbeing. In this paper, we present early results from a
		  pilot study in rural Bangladesh using a ‘microtasks for
		  micropayments’ model to collect a range of community and
		  household living standards data using Android smartphones.
		  We find that more frequent task repetition with shorter
		  recall periods leads to more inclusive reporting, improved
		  capture of intra-seasonal variability, and earlier signals
		  of events such as illness. Payments in the form of mobile
		  talk time and data provide a positive development
		  externality in the form of expanded access to mobile
		  internet and social networks. Taken to scale, programs such
		  as this have potential to transform data collection in
		  rural areas, providing near-real-time windows into the
		  development of markets, the spread of illnesses, or the
		  diffusion of ideas and innovations.},

		  sums of exponentials or Gaussians in Beylkin and Monzón
		  (2005) [16] to discuss several new results and applications
		  of these approximations. By using the Poisson summation to
		  discretize integral representations of e.g., power
		  functions r−β, β>0, we obtain approximations with
		  uniform relative error on the whole real line. Our approach
		  is applicable to a class of functions and, in particular,
		  yields a separated representation for the function e−xy.
		  As a result, we obtain sharper error estimates and a
		  simpler method to derive trapezoidal-type quadratures valid
		  on finite intervals. We also introduce a new reduction
		  algorithm for the case where our representation has an
		  excessive number of terms with small exponents. As an
		  application of these new estimates, we simplify and improve
		  previous results on separated representations of operators
		  with radial kernels. For any finite but arbitrary accuracy,
		  we obtain new separated representations of solutions of
		  Laplace's equation satisfying boundary conditions on the
		  half-space or the sphere. These representations inherit a
		  multiresolution structure from the Gaussian approximation
		  leading to fast algorithms for the evaluation of the
		  solutions. In the case of the sphere, our approach provides
		  a foundation for a new multiresolution approach to
		  evaluating and estimating models of gravitational
		  potentials used for satellite orbit computations.}

  abstract	= { The capital asset pricing model provides a theoretical
		  structure for the pricing of assets with uncertain returns.
		  The premium to induc e risk-averse investors to bear risk
		  is proportional to the nondivers ifiable risk, which is
		  measured by the covariance of the asset return with the
		  market portfolio return. In this paper, a multivariate, gen
		  eralized-autoregressive, conditional, heteroscedastic
		  process is esti mated for returns to bills, bonds, and
		  stocks where the expected retu rn is proportional to the
		  conditional covariance of each return with that of a fully
		  diversified or market portfolio. It is found that the
		  conditional covariances are quite variable over time and
		  are a signi ficant determinant of the time-varying risk
		  premia. The implied betas are also time varying and
		  forecastable. Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago
		  Press.}

		  The decision-theoretic approach starts from the assumption
		  that the rationality of the players is common knowledge.
		  This leads to the notion of correlated rationalizability.
		  It is shown that correlated rationalizability is e
		  quivalent to a posteriori equilibrium-a refinement of
		  subjective corr elated equilibrium. Hence a
		  decision-theoretic justification for the equilibrium
		  approach to game theory is provided. An analogous equival
		  ence result is proved between independent
		  rationalizability, which is the appropriate concept if each
		  player believes that the others act independently, and
		  conditionally independent a posteriori equilibrium.

		  of the household members may affect the final allocation
		  decisions made by the household. A method of identifying
		  how incomes affect outcomes, given conventional family
		  expenditure data, is developed. The basic assumption the
		  analysis makes is that household decision processes lead to
		  efficient outcomes. The method is applied to a sample of
		  Canadian couples with no children. The analysis finds that
		  the final allocations of expenditures on each partner
		  depend significantly on their relative incomes and ages and
		  on the level of lifetime wealth. These effects are highly
		  significant in a statistical sense. They also suggest that
		  the influence of differential incomes and wealth on

		  are defined as variables that affect the household members'
		  bargaining position but not preferences or the joint budget
		  set. We extend the collective labor supply model developed
		  by Chiappori to allow for distribution factors. We show
		  that our model imposes new restrictions on the labor supply
		  functions and eases the identification of individual
		  preferences and the intrahousehold decision process. The

  abstract	= {Every year, 90 percent of Americans give money to
		  charities. Is such generosity necessarily welfare enhancing
		  for the giver? We present a theoretical framework that
		  distinguishes two types of motivation: individuals like to
		  give, e.g., due to altruism or warm glow, and individuals
		  would rather not give but dislike saying no, e.g., due to
		  social pressure. We design a door-to-door fund-raising
		  drive in which some households are informed about the exact
		  time of solicitation with a flyer on their door-knobs;
		  thus, they can seek or avoid the fund-raiser. We find that
		  the flyer reduces the share of households opening the door
		  by 10 to 25 percent and, if the flyer allows checking a `Do
		  Not Disturb' box, reduces giving by 30 percent. The latter
		  decrease is concentrated among donations smaller than \$10.
		  These findings suggest that social pressure is an important
		  determinant of door-to-door giving. Combining data from
		  this and a complementary field experiment, we structurally
		  estimate the model. The estimated social pressure cost of
		  saying no to a solicitor is \$3.5 for an in-state charity
		  and \$1.4 for an out-of-state charity. Our welfare
		  calculations suggest that our door-to-door fund-raising
		  campaigns on average lower utility of the potential donors.}

		  focus is on whether shocks affect growth. Rainfall shocks
		  have a substantial impact on consumption growth, and its
		  impact presists for many years. There also appears to be a
		  significant, persistent growth impact from the large-scale
		  famine in the 1980s, as well as substantial externalities
		  from the presence of road infrastructure. The findings
		  related to the persistent effects of rainfall shocks and
		  the famine crisis imply that welfare losses due to the lack

		  welfare cost of short term consumption fluctuations.}

		  subject to finite sample bias. I show that the standard
		  errors-in-variables estimator (EVE) is exactly equivalent
		  to the Jackknife Instrumental Variables Estimator (JIVE),
		  and use this relationship to develop an estimator which,
		  unlike EVE, is unbiased in finite samples. The theoretical
		  results are demonstrated using Monte Carlo experiments.
		  Finally, I implement a model of intertemporal male labor
		  supply using microdata from the United States Census. There
		  are sizeable differences in the wage elasticity across
		  estimators, showing the practical importance of the
		  theoretical issues even when the sample size is quite
		  large.}

  abstract	= {This chapter reviews the literature identifying the
		  different roles that family and kinship networks play in
		  sharing risk. After a brief overview of efficient risk
		  sharing, we discuss the channels by which households pool
		  risk and the motives for entering in binding informal
		  arrangements. Informal risk sharing arrangements are often
		  thought to be enforced via reciprocal repeated
		  relationships that are not family or kin specific. Other
		  explanations draw from behavioral psychology and
		  evolutionary biology and emphasize the link between gene
		  transmission, family ties, and altruism. Next, we turn to
		  the formation of risk sharing arrangements, either as
		  partially overlapping networks or as risk sharing groups.
		  We find that both types of arrangements often coexist and
		  complement each other. The nature of strategic interactions
		  among individuals and households has been shown to affect
		  the stability of the resulting risk sharing equilibria. We
		  finish with a discussion of the available evidence on
		  strategic link and group formation. JEL Codes: D6}

  abstract	= {A method is proposed in this paper for predicting
		  Electoral College victory probabilities from state
		  probability data. A "ranking" assumption about dependencies
		  across states is made that greatly simplifies the analysis.
		  The method issued to analyze state probability data from
		  the Intrade political betting market. The Intrade prices of
		  various contracts are quite close to what would be expected
		  under the ranking assumption. Under the joint hypothesis
		  that the Intrade price ranking is correct and the ranking
		  assumption is correct, President Bush should not have won
		  any state ranked below a state that he lost. He did not win
		  any such state. The ranking assumption is also consistent
		  with the fact that the two parties spent essentially
		  nothing in most states in 2004.}

		  successful empirical models in economics and has long
		  played a central role in the trade literature (Anderson,
		  2011). Different approaches to estimate the gravity
		  equation, i.e. reduced-form or more structural, have been
		  proposed. This paper examines the role of adding-up
		  constraints as the key difference between structural
		  gravity with “multilateral resistance” indexes and
		  reduced-form gravity with simple fixed effects by exporter
		  and importer. In particular, estimating gravity equations
		  using the Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood estimator
		  (Poisson PML) with fixed effects automatically satisfies
		  these constraints and is consistent with the introduction
		  of “multilateral resistance” indexes as in Anderson and
		  van Wincoop (2003)."

		  a potentially infinite chain of reasoning about knowledge.
		  The purpose of this paper is to survey some of the
		  implications for economic behavior of the hypotheses that
		  events are common knowledge, that actions are common
		  knowledge, that optimization is common knowledge, and that
		  rationality is common knowledge. It will begin with several
		  puzzles that illustrate the strength of the common
		  knowledge hypothesis. It will then study how common
		  knowledge can illuminate many problems in economics. In
		  general, the discussion will show that a talent for
		  interactive thinking is advantageous, but if everyone can
		  think interactively and deeply all the way to common
		  knowledge, then sometimes puzzling consequences may
		  result.}

    abstract = {This book updates and advances the theory of expected utility as applied to risk analysis and financial decision making. Von Neumann and Morgenstern pioneered the use of expected utility theory in the 1940s, but most utility functions used in financial management are still relatively simplistic and assume a mean-variance world. Taking into account recent advances in the economics of risk and uncertainty, this book focuses on richer applications of expected utility in finance, macroeconomics, and environmental economics.The book covers these topics: expected utility theory and related concepts; the standard portfolio problem of choice under uncertainty involving two different assets; P the basic hyperplane separation theorem and log-supermodular functions as technical tools for solving various decision-making problems under uncertainty; s choice involving multiple risks; the Arrow-Debreu portfolio problem; consumption and saving; the equilibrium price of risk and time in an Arrow-Debreu economy; and dynamic models of decision making when a flow of information on future risks is expected over time. The book is appropriate for both students and professionals. Concepts are presented intuitively as well as formally, and the theory is balanced by empirical considerations. Each chapter concludes with a problem set.},

  abstract	= {This paper examines the econometric causal model and the
		  interpretation of empirical evidence based on thought
		  experiments that was developed by Ragnar Frisch and Trygve
		  Haavelmo. We compare the econometric causal model with two
		  currently popular causal frameworks: the Neyman-Rubin
		  causal model and the Do-Calculus. The Neyman-Rubin causal
		  model is based on the language of potential outcomes and
		  was largely developed by statisticians. Instead of being
		  based on thought experiments, it takes statistical
		  experiments as its foundation. The Do-Calculus, developed
		  by Judea Pearl and co-authors, relies on Directed Acyclic
		  Graphs (DAGs) and is a popular causal framework in computer
		  science and applied mathematics. We make the case that
		  economists who uncritically use these frameworks often
		  discard the substantial benefits of the econometric causal
		  model to the detriment of more informative analyses. We
		  illustrate the versatility and capabilities of the
		  econometric framework using causal models developed in
		  economics.},

  abstract	= {We consider the estimation and inference in approximate
		  factor models with random missing values. We show that with
		  the low rank structure of the common component, we can
		  estimate the factors and factor loadings consistently with
		  the missing values replaced by zeros. We establish the
		  asymptotic distributions of the resulting estimators and
		  those based on the EM algorithm. We also propose a
		  cross-validation-based method to determine the number of
		  factors in factor models with or without missing values and
		  justify its consistency. Simulations demonstrate that our
		  cross validation method is robust to fat tails in the error
		  distribution and significantly outperforms some existing
		  popular methods in terms of correct percentage in
		  determining the number of factors. An application to the
		  factor-augmented regression models shows that a proper
		  treatment of the missing values can improve the
		  out-of-sample forecast of some macroeconomic variables.}

		  answer the same questions differently depending on whether
		  they are interviewed with a short questionnaire or its
		  longer counterpart. Statistically significant differences
		  in reporting emerge across all topics and question types.
		  In proxy-based poverty measurement, these reporting
		  differences lead to significantly different predicted
		  poverty rates and Gini coefficients. The difference in
		  poverty predictions ranges from 3 to 7 percentage points,
		  depending on the model specification. A prediction model
		  based only on the proxies that are elicited prior to the
		  variation in questionnaire design yields identical poverty
		  predictions irrespective of the short-versus-long
		  questionnaire treatment. The results are relevant for
		  estimating trends with questionnaires exhibiting
		  inter-temporal variation in design, impact evaluations
		  administering questionnaires of different length and
		  complexity to treatment and control samples, and
		  development programs utilizing proxy-means tests for
		  targeting.},

		  This paper derives the indirect utility functions that

		  sufficient conditions for their global or nearly global

		  relative performance contracts. Information-constrained
		  optimal distributions of organizations and contracts are
		  shown to be functions of the underlying primitives, in
		  particular, the distribution of Pareto weights, and hence
		  degree of inequality. Internal inequality of a potential,
		  local group is a force for collective organization. That
		  is, multi-agent organizations exist in order to extract
		  wealth from some but not necessarily all members. The group
		  organization is also shown to be information-constrained
		  Pareto optimal at extremes of local wealth relative to an
		  outsider. However, the group organization is susceptible to
		  both agents simultaneously deviating, colluding against the
		  outsider, and this distortion makes an individualistic,
		  relative performance contract an attractive alternative."

  abstract	= {A section of the informal credit market in an agrarian
		  society is explored, namely the usufructuary land mortgage,
		  a type of money-lending contract that is common in rural
		  economies of South Asia. In this type of transaction, the
		  lender charges no explicit interest on the loan, but since
		  the mortgagee is free to utilize the land for his own
		  cultivation, net income from the land is, in effect, an
		  implicit form of interest payment. Issues relating to the
		  determination of the rate of interest and the oft-found
		  phenomenon of undervaluation of the collateral are
		  discussed. A model is provided that shows the proper
		  relationship between undervaluation of collaterals and the
		  high implicit usufruct rates of interest. This relationship
		  can only be understood by defining the opportunity cost of
		  money in terms of purchasing new land. It is shown that,
		  for any rate of default less than 100\%, return from
		  moneylending is lower than return from land purchase under
		  certain circumstances. It is then argued that
		  undervaluation of collateral may be a mechanism to
		  compensate the lender for the opportunity cost of his
		  funds.},

		  insurance under limited commitment and a model of public
		  unemployment insurance subject to moral hazard in an
		  economy with a continuum of agents and an infinite time
		  horizon. The dynamic and steady-state properties of the
		  optimum private unemployment insurance scheme are
		  established. The interaction between public and private
		  unemployment insurance schemes is examined. Examples are
		  constructed to show that for some parameter values
		  increased public insurance can reduce welfare by crowding
		  out private insurance more than one-to-one and that for
		  other parameter values a mix of both public and private
		  insurance can be welfare maximizing. Copyright 2007

		  about job openings within their social networks. Agents are
		  more likely to be employed if their social contacts are
		  also employed. The model generates a stationary
		  distribution of unemployment that exhibits positive spatial
		  correlations. I estimate the model via an indirect
		  inference procedure, using Census Tract data for Chicago. I
		  find a significantly positive amount of social interactions
		  across neighbouring tracts. The local spillovers are
		  stronger for areas with less educated workers and higher
		  fractions of minorities. Furthermore, they are shaped by
		  ethnic dividing lines and neighbourhood boundaries.},

		  that vary in sensitivity to transitory shocks, and target
		  small cash transfers. We find little evidence that

abstract = {Concavifiable convex preference orderings are characterized and minimally concave utilities are constructed, using three different approaches. One involves the intersection of arbitrary lines with the three indifference surfaces, another involves conditions on the normals of two indifference surfaces and is related to the super-gradient map of a possible concave utility. In the third approach it is assumed that the ordering is induced by a twice-differentiable utility and Perror's integral of a certain expression formed from the derivatives is used. A possible economic interpretation of minimally concave utilities is suggested, and it is shown that one cannot select concave utilities so that they depend continuously on the ordering.}
