  abstract	= "This paper augments the neoclassical growth model to study
		  the macroeconomic effects of uninsured idiosyncratic
		  investment, or capital-income, risk. Under standard
		  assumptions for preferences and technologies, individual
		  policy rules are linear in individual wealth, ensuring that
		  the equilibrium dynamics for aggregate quantities and
		  prices are independent of the wealth distribution. The
		  analysis thus remains highly tractable despite the
		  incompleteness of markets. As compared to complete markets,
		  the steady state is characterized by both a lower interest
		  rate and a lower capital stock when the elasticity of
		  intertemporal substitution is higher than the fraction of
		  private equity in total wealth. For empirically plausible
		  parameterizations, this condition is easily satisfied, and
		  the reduction in aggregate saving and income is
		  quantitatively significant. These findings contrast with
		  Bewley models, where idiosyncratic labor-income risk leads
		  to higher aggregate saving and income."

		  with a dynamic model which focuses on the role of
		  incomplete insurance in generating inequality. Unlike
		  previous work, our approach takes explicit account of the
		  reason for market incompleteness in modeling agents'
		  behaviour; in particular, the amount of risk borne is
		  endogenous. Using a model of growth with altruism in which
		  agents are risk-averse and there is moral hazard, we show
		  that lineage wealth follows a Markov process which
		  converges globally to an ergodic distribution; this also
		  represents the long-run population distribution of wealth.
		  We discuss the role of particular assumptions, such as
		  availability of production loans and unboundedness of
		  utility, in yielding the qualitative properties of the
		  distribution of wealth, the choice of "occupation", and the
		  prevention of poverty traps.},

		  consistent with the observed expenditure patterns of

		  surveys and is also able to provide a detailed welfare
		  analysis of shifts in relative prices. A nonparametric
		  analysis of consumer expenditure patterns suggests that
		  Engel curves require quadratic terms in the logarithm of
		  expenditure. While popular models of demand such as the
		  Translog or the Almost Ideal Demand Systems do allow
		  flexible price responses within a theoretically coherent
		  structure, they have expenditure share Engel curves that
		  are linear in the logarithm of total expenditure. We derive
		  the complete class of integrable quadratic logarithmic
		  expenditure share systems. A specification from this class
		  is estimated on a large pooled data set of U.K. households.
		  Models that fail to account for Engel curvature are found
		  to generate important distortions in the patterns of
		  welfare losses associated with a tax increase.},

  abstract	= {We study optimal enforcement in credit markets in which
		  the only threat facing a defaulting borrower is restricted
		  access to financial markets. We solve for the optimal level
		  of exclusion, and link it to observed institutional
		  arrangements. Regulation in this environment must
		  accomplish two objectives. First, it must prevent borrowers
		  from defaulting on one bank and transferring their
		  resources to another bank. Second, and less obviously, it
		  must give banks the incentive to make sizeable loans, and
		  to honour their promises of future credit. We establish
		  that the optimal regulation resembles observed laws
		  governing default on debt. Moreover, if debtors have the
		  right to a "fresh start" after bankruptcy then this must be
		  balanced by enforceable provisions against fraudulent
		  conveyance. Our optimal regulation is robust, in that it
		  can be implemented in a way that does not require the
		  regulator to have information about either the borrower or
		  lender. Our results isolate the way in which specific
		  institutions surrounding bankruptcy-namely rules governing
		  asset garnishment and fraudulent conveyances-support loan
		  markets in which borrowers have no collateral.},

		  of the household members may affect the final allocation
		  decisions made by the household. A method of identifying
		  how incomes affect outcomes, given conventional family
		  expenditure data, is developed. The basic assumption the
		  analysis makes is that household decision processes lead to
		  efficient outcomes. The method is applied to a sample of
		  Canadian couples with no children. The analysis finds that
		  the final allocations of expenditures on each partner
		  depend significantly on their relative incomes and ages and
		  on the level of lifetime wealth. These effects are highly
		  significant in a statistical sense. They also suggest that
		  the influence of differential incomes and wealth on
		  intrahousehold allocation can be fairly substantial.}

		  sex ratio in the marriage market and the rules governing
		  divorce are examples of distribution factors. These factors
		  are defined as variables that affect the household members'
		  bargaining position but not preferences or the joint budget
		  set. We extend the collective labor supply model developed
		  by Chiappori to allow for distribution factors. We show
		  that our model imposes new restrictions on the labor supply
		  functions and eases the identification of individual
		  preferences and the intrahousehold decision process. The
		  model is estimated using PSID data for the year 1988.'"

		  charities. Is such generosity necessarily welfare enhancing
		  for the giver? We present a theoretical framework that
		  distinguishes two types of motivation: individuals like to
		  give, e.g., due to altruism or warm glow, and individuals
		  would rather not give but dislike saying no, e.g., due to
		  social pressure. We design a door-to-door fund-raising
		  drive in which some households are informed about the exact
		  time of solicitation with a flyer on their door-knobs;
		  thus, they can seek or avoid the fund-raiser. We find that
		  the flyer reduces the share of households opening the door
		  by 10 to 25 percent and, if the flyer allows checking a `Do
		  Not Disturb' box, reduces giving by 30 percent. The latter
		  decrease is concentrated among donations smaller than \$10.
		  These findings suggest that social pressure is an important
		  determinant of door-to-door giving. Combining data from
		  this and a complementary field experiment, we structurally
		  estimate the model. The estimated social pressure cost of
		  saying no to a solicitor is \$3.5 for an in-state charity
		  and \$1.4 for an out-of-state charity. Our welfare
		  calculations suggest that our door-to-door fund-raising
		  campaigns on average lower utility of the potential donors.}

		  also provides social insurance. In the benchmark case, more
		  generous State transfers crowd out family risk-sharing
		  one-for-one. An extension gives the State an advantage in
		  enforcing transfers through taxes (whereas families rely on
		  self-enforcement). More generous State transfers lead to
		  more than one-for-one reductions in intra-family insurance,
		  so that total transfers to the unemployed fall as the
		  State's generosity increases. This does not imply that the
		  optimal size of the Welfare State is zero. Our results
		  still hold when families are assumed to be better than the
		  State at monitoring job search activities of unemployed.},

		  transactions costs; relationships with potential lenders;
		  and family relationships. No evidence was found that social

		  institutions. Membership in a community where individuals
		  are dynastically linked has two effects on informal credit.
		  First, the nonanonymity of the dynastic link allows to
		  sanction the defaulters' offspring and induce compliance
		  even in short-term interactions (social enforcement).
		  Second, preferential agreements can arise in which kin
		  members condition their behavior on the characteristics of
		  a player's predecessor, expecting others to do the same
		  with their offspring (reciprocity). These effects are
		  incorporated in an OLG game with endogenous matching
		  between lenders and borrowers and tested using

		  allocation and taxing rules that depend on information
		  communicated to the government by consumers regarding their
		  preferences. A wide range of strategic behavior for
		  consumers in their communication with the government is
		  allowed; in particular, consumers may understate their
		  preferences and be "free riders" if they choose. Although
		  several examples of allocation-taxation schemes falling
		  within the general model are discussed, the major
		  contribution of the paper is the formulation of a
		  particular government allocation-taxation scheme for which
		  the behavioral equilibria are Pareto optimal. That is,
		  given the government rules, consumers find it in their
		  self-interest to reveal their true preferences for public
		  goods.},

  abstract	= {This paper considers the use of instrumental variables to
		  estimate the mean effect of treatment on the treated, the
		  mean effect of treatment on randomly selected persons and
		  the local average treatment effect. It examines what
		  economic questions these parameters address. When responses
		  to treatment vary, the standard argument justifying the use
		  of instrumental variables fails unless person-specific
		  responses to treatment do not influence decisions to
		  participate in the program being evaluated. This requires
		  that individual gains from the program that cannot be
		  predicted from variables in outcome equations do not
		  influence the decision of the persons being studied to
		  participate in the program. In the likely case in which
		  individuals possess and act on private information about
		  gains from the program that cannot be fully predicted by
		  variables in the outcome equation, instrumental variables
		  methods do not estimate economically interesting evaluation
		  parameters. Instrumental variable methods are extremely
		  sensitive to assumptions about how people process
		  information. These arguments are developed for both
		  continuous and discrete treatment variables and several
		  explicit economic models are presented.},

  abstract	= {Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1992), Baxter and Crucini
		  (1995), and Stockman and Tesar (1995) find two major
		  discrepancies between standard international business cycle
		  models with complete markets and the data: In the models,
		  cross-country correlations are much higher for consumption
		  than for output, while in the data the opposite is true;
		  and cross-country correlations of employment and investment
		  are negative, while in the data they are positive. This
		  paper introduces a friction into a standard model that
		  helps resolve these anomalies. The friction is that
		  international loans are imperfectly enforceable; any
		  country can renege on its debts and suffer the consequences
		  for future borrowing. To solve for equilibrium in this
		  economy with endogenous incomplete markets, the methods of
		  Marcet and Marimon (1999) are extended. Incorporating the
		  friction helps resolve the anomalies more than does
		  exogenously restricting the assets that can be traded.},

		  affected by the presence of price and yield risk.
		  Reduced-form and structural models of crop choices are
		  estimated. Although the paper cannot reject the hypothesis
		  that village members efficiently share risk among
		  themselves, production choices are shown to depend on risk.
		  Existing risk sharing and self-insurance mechanisms thus
		  imperfectly protect Punjab farmers against village-level
		  shocks. Results also indicate that households respond to
		  consumption price risk, thereby suggesting that empirical
		  and theoretical work on risk should avoid putting an
		  exclusive emphasis on yield and output price risk."

		  with relative performance contracts.
		  Information-constrained optimal distributions of
		  organizations and contracts are shown to be functions of
		  the underlying primitives, in particular, the distribution
		  of Pareto weights, and hence degree of inequality. Internal
		  inequality of a potential, local group is a force for
		  collective organization. That is, multi-agent organizations
		  exist in order to extract wealth from some but not
		  necessarily all members. The group organization is also
		  shown to be information-constrained Pareto optimal at
		  extremes of local wealth relative to an outsider. However,
		  the group organization is susceptible to both agents
		  simultaneously deviating, colluding against the outsider,
		  and this distortion makes an individualistic, relative
		  performance contract an attractive alternative.'"

		  insurance under limited commitment and a model of public
		  unemployment insurance subject to moral hazard in an
		  economy with a continuum of agents and an infinite time
		  horizon. The dynamic and steady-state properties of the
		  optimum private unemployment insurance scheme are
		  established. The interaction between public and private
		  unemployment insurance schemes is examined. Examples are
		  constructed to show that for some parameter values
		  increased public insurance can reduce welfare by crowding
		  out private insurance more than one-to-one and that for
		  other parameter values a mix of both public and private
		  insurance can be welfare maximizing. Copyright 2007

		  about job openings within their social networks. Agents are
		  more likely to be employed if their social contacts are
		  also employed. The model generates a stationary
		  distribution of unemployment that exhibits positive spatial
		  correlations. I estimate the model via an indirect
		  inference procedure, using Census Tract data for Chicago. I
		  find a significantly positive amount of social interactions
		  across neighbouring tracts. The local spillovers are
		  stronger for areas with less educated workers and higher
		  fractions of minorities. Furthermore, they are shaped by
		  ethnic dividing lines and neighbourhood boundaries.},

    abstract={The vast majority of randomized experiments in economics rely on a single baseline and single follow-up survey. While such a design is suitable for study of highly autocorrelated and relatively precisely measured outcomes in the health and education domains, it is unlikely to be optimal for measuring noisy and relatively less autocorrelated outcomes such as business profits, and household incomes and expenditures. Taking multiple measurements of such outcomes at relatively short intervals allows one to average out noise, increasing power. When the outcomes have low autocorrelation and budget is limited, it can make sense to do no baseline at all. Moreover, I show how for such outcomes, more power can be achieved with multiple follow-ups than allocating the same total sample size over a single follow-up and baseline. I also highlight the large gains in power from ANCOVA analysis rather than difference-in-differences analysis when autocorrelations are low.},

  pages={301--312},
  year={1996},

  remarks={Estimates demand systems using different standard
                  approaches, but either imposing restrictions from
                  demand theory or not.  Not imposing restrictions
                  leads to better within-sample fit (by construction),
                  but out-of-sample forecasting ability was better
                  when restrictions from theory were imposed.}

The purpose of this paper is to survey some of the implications for economic behavior of the hypotheses that events are common knowledge, that actions are common knowledge, that optimization is common knowledge, and that rationality is common knowledge. It will begin with several puzzles that illustrate the strength of the common knowledge hypothesis. It will then study how common knowledge can illuminate many problems in economics. In general, the discussion will show that a talent for interactive thinking is advantageous, but if everyone can think interactively and deeply all the way to common knowledge, then sometimes puzzling consequences may result.}}

The idea is to use the score of a density that has an analytic expression to define the GMM criterion. The auxiliary model that generates the score should closely approximate the distribution' of the observed data but is not required to nest it. If the auxiliary model nests the structural model then the estimator is as efficient as maximum likelihood. The estimator is advantageous when expectations under a structural model can be computed by simulation, by quadrature, or by analytic expressions but the likelihood cannot be computed easily.}}

In addition to obtaining direct measures of the completeness of employer information we consider the implications of information asymmetries for the structure of casual labor markets. We then evaluate the extent to which casual labor markets do, in fact, exhibit these attributes. We find that: (1) there is adverse selection out of the time-rate labor market; (2) employers discriminate statistically: given two workers with different observed characteristics but the same actual productivity, the worker from the group with the higher average productivity will have a higher wage; (3) employers exhibit learning over time: the extent of employer ignorance is negatively related to labor-market exposure on the part of the workers; and (4) calorie consumption affects productivity but is not rewarded in the time-rate labor market. In concluding we argue that an analysis of wage and employment patterns and the implications of these patterns for human capital investment in rural areas of developing countries that ignored the role of information problems could yield misleading conclusions.}}

We then show how this welfare loss can be estimated empirically using identifying variation in the price of insurance. Such variation, together with quantity data, allows us to estimate the demand for insurance. The same variation, together with cost data, allows us to estimate how insurer's costs vary as market participants endogenously respond to price. The slope of this estimated cost curve provides a direct test for both the existence and nature of selection, and the combination of demand and cost curves can be used to estimate welfare. We illustrate our approach by applying it to data on employer-provided health insurance from one speci?c company. We detect adverse selection but estimate that the quantitative welfare implications associated with inefficient pricing in our particular application are small, in both absolute and relative terms.}}

Predictable variation is estimated to be about 40 percent of 3 to 5-year return variances for portfolios of small firms. The percentage falls to around 25 percent for portfolios of large firms.

Under the joint hypothesis that the Intrade price ranking is correct and the ranking assumption is correct, President Bush should not have won any state ranked below a state that he lost. He did not win any such state. The ranking assumption is also consistent with the fact that the two parties spent essentially nothing in most states in 2004.}}

Consumption grew substantially, but with diverse experiences across villages and individuals. A key focus is on whether shocks affect growth. Rainfall shocks have a substantial impact on consumption growth, and its impact presists for many years. There also appears to be a significant, persistent growth impact from the large-scale famine in the 1980s, as well as substantial externalities from the presence of road infrastructure. The findings related to the persistent effects of rainfall shocks and the famine crisis imply that welfare losses due to the lack of insurance and protection measures are well beyond the welfare cost of short term consumption fluctuations.}}

The theoretical results are demonstrated using Monte Carlo experiments. Finally, I implement a model of intertemporal male labor supply using microdata from the United States Census. There are sizeable differences in the wage elasticity across estimators, showing the practical importance of the theoretical issues even when the sample size is quite large.}}

abstract = {The authors discuss the unity between the two standard approaches to noncooperative solution concepts for games. The decision-theoretic approach starts from the assumption that the rationality of the players is common knowledge. This leads to the notion of correlated rationalizability. It is shown that correlated rationalizability is e quivalent to a posteriori equilibrium-a refinement of subjective corr elated equilibrium. Hence a decision-theoretic justification for the equilibrium approach to game theory is provided. An analogous equival ence result is proved between independent rationalizability, which is the appropriate concept if each player believes that the others act independently, and conditionally independent a posteriori equilibrium.

abstract = { The capital asset pricing model provides a theoretical structure for the pricing of assets with uncertain returns. The premium to induc e risk-averse investors to bear risk is proportional to the nondivers ifiable risk, which is measured by the covariance of the asset return with the market portfolio return. In this paper, a multivariate, gen eralized-autoregressive, conditional, heteroscedastic process is esti mated for returns to bills, bonds, and stocks where the expected retu rn is proportional to the conditional covariance of each return with that of a fully diversified or market portfolio. It is found that the conditional covariances are quite variable over time and are a signi ficant determinant of the time-varying risk premia. The implied betas are also time varying and forecastable.
